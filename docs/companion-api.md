# Companion read API (`/api/v1`)

The read contract the **sales-companion** UX (`/Users/mac01/Documents/sales-companion`)
consumes. AtamuraOKK is the backend of record for everything call-quality; the
companion is a pure consumer — it pulls scorecards/feedback over HTTP and writes
nothing. This is an **anti-corruption layer**: the pipeline's internal `status`
enum and raw table shape never appear in a response, so the pipeline can evolve
behind it.

## Status

**Phase 1 (live now) — call-quality axis.** Backed entirely by data the pipeline
already produces (`scores` → the `call_scores_latest` view). Ships today.

**Phase 2 (deferred) — money axis.** Conversion (meetings ÷ leads), план %,
CRM-дисциплина. Not wired: requires a new `crm.deal.list`/`crm.lead.list`
ingestion concern + a per-manager metrics table, and the numbers are only
trustworthy after the Bitrix data-cleanup gate (see sales-companion
`docs/handoff.md`). The `money` object is **published now with null values** and
`status: "not_available"` so the companion can code against the final shape.

## Auth — two layers

1. **Service bearer.** Every `/api/v1/*` request must carry
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` matching `ATAMURAOKK_COMPANION_API_TOKEN`.
   The companion's nginx injects it server-side, so the browser never holds it.
   **Fail-closed:** if the token is unset the API returns `503` rather than
   serving data unauthenticated.
2. **Personal user key** (`X-Companion-User-Key`, sent by the browser). Two
   sources, checked in order:
   - the **static РОП key** — `ATAMURAOKK_COMPANION_HEAD_KEY`. A fixed code set
     once in the environment; logging in with it grants `head` with no
     `companion_users` row. Compared in constant time; empty = disabled.
   - a `companion_users` row (only the SHA-256 of the key is stored) carrying
     the **role**:
     - `manager` — scoped to their own `bitrix_user_id`: own
       scorecard/calls/day and only their own calls' feedback; anything else is
       `403`. The team rollup is `403`.
     - `head` — руководитель отдела продаж: every manager + the team rollup.

   Missing/invalid/revoked key → `401`. Manager keys are issued and revoked by
   the head **from the cabinet** (`/users` endpoints below) or with
   `python -m AtamuraOKK.companion_users create|list|revoke` (the raw key is
   shown once at creation in both flows). Head keys are never issued via the
   API — only the static key or the CLI.

## Identifiers

Path params are **Bitrix** ids, since the companion is a Bitrix24 app and holds
those, not AtamuraOKK's internal row ids:

- `manager_id` → Bitrix user id (`managers.bitrix_user_id`)
- `department_id` → Bitrix department id (`departments.bitrix_id`)
- `call_id` (feedback only) → AtamuraOKK internal call id (from the call feed)

## ОКК 0–100 → 1–5

The companion needs ОКК as a 1–5 bonus modifier; the pipeline stores a 0–100
percent. The single mapping (`web/api/v1/okk.py`), aligned to the rubric zones:

| percent | ОКК | zone |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 90 | 5 | strong |
| 85–89 | 4 | strong |
| 80–84 | 3 | normal |
| 75–79 | 2 | borderline |
| < 75 | 1 | risk |

Only genuine qualification calls (`is_qualification_call`) count toward the
score; reminders/vendor/internal/wrong-number calls are excluded.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/me` | who am I — role + linked manager profile (the cabinet boots from this) |
| GET | `/api/v1/managers/{manager_id}/scorecard?period=YYYY-MM` | ОКК scorecard (`okk` + `zone_distribution` + `meetings` + null `money`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/managers/{manager_id}/calls?since=&limit=` | Звонки feed — scored calls, newest first |
| GET | `/api/v1/calls/{call_id}/feedback` | авто-разбор за 90 сек — summary/strengths/growth/criteria |
| GET | `/api/v1/managers/{manager_id}/meetings?since=&limit=` | Встречи feed — scored ОП meetings, newest first |
| GET | `/api/v1/meetings/{meeting_id}/feedback` | авто-разбор for one meeting — score/tone/red flags/criteria |
| GET | `/api/v1/managers/{manager_id}/feed?since=&limit=` | unified Звонки+Встречи feed — kind-tagged items, newest first |
| GET | `/api/v1/rubrics` | active criteria set per `source` (`"tm"` calls / `"op"` meetings) |
| GET | `/api/v1/teams/{department_id}/summary?period=YYYY-MM` | РОП-вид — per-manager roster + group rollup, calls **and** meetings (**head only**) |
| GET | `/api/v1/users` | all cabinet users — access-management list (**head only**) |
| POST | `/api/v1/users` | issue a **manager** key (`{bitrix_user_id, name?}`); raw key returned once (**head only**) |
| POST | `/api/v1/users/{id}/revoke` | deactivate a manager's key; head rows are `403` (CLI-only) (**head only**) |

`period` defaults to the current month in `report_timezone`; a malformed value
returns `422`. Unknown manager/department/call returns `404`; a manager asking
for anyone but themselves gets `403`.

Meetings come from the ОП meeting pipeline (`AtamuraOKK/scoring/meetings/`):
scored recordings are mirrored into the Postgres `meetings` table by its
`push` stage and attributed to **whoever uploaded the recording** to the
"Встречи ОП" Disk folder (`uploaded_by_bitrix_id`), so `manager_id` in the
meetings paths is that uploader's Bitrix user id. A meeting with no usable
uploader is visible to the head only. Each row carries a `source` tag
(`"op"` today) so other departments' recordings can be distinguished later.

### Per-department items and criteria

Meetings live **in the same place as calls** — a department's scored items
are whatever it produces (ТМ → calls, ОП → meetings), and each department
scores against **its own criteria**. The two scoring semantics are
deliberately distinct and never forced into one scale: calls carry
percent/zone/`okk_5`, meetings carry `score_pct`/`passed`.

- `ManagerScorecard` and the team summary's `group` each carry both blocks:
  the existing `okk`/`zone_distribution` (calls) plus a `meetings` aggregate
  (`meetings_scored`, `avg_score_pct`, `passed`, `failed`,
  `needs_human_review`). Whichever a manager/department doesn't produce is
  simply zero/null — no department→type mapping needs maintaining. Note:
  `meetings` on the scorecard is the scored-recordings aggregate, distinct
  from the planned `MoneyAxis.meetings` deal counter.
- The team summary's roster is the **union** of call-managers and
  meeting-managers in the department. Meetings tie into the department via
  the uploader's `managers` row (`manager_id → department_id`), so a meeting
  whose uploader is still an unenriched placeholder (no department yet) is
  invisible in the rollup until ingestion's `ensure_managers` backfills the
  profile — permanent only if the webhook lacks the `user` scope.
- `/managers/{id}/feed` merges both feeds into one kind-tagged list
  (`{kind: "call"|"meeting", at, call?, meeting?}`), newest first, so the
  cabinet renders one screen regardless of department.
- `/rubrics` returns the active criteria set per `source` (one active rubric
  per source, seeded by `make seed-rubric` into `rubric_versions`), letting
  the cabinet show each department's own checklist behind the numbers.

When issuing a key, `name` is optional: omitted, OKK resolves the display
name from the Bitrix user id — first from its own `managers` table (already
enriched from `user.get` by ingestion), else via a live read-only `user.get`.
If neither resolves (bad id, or the webhook lacks the `user` scope) the
request is `422` with a hint to pass `name` explicitly.

The `/users` endpoints are the one writable surface — they write only
AtamuraOKK's own `companion_users` table (never the pipeline or Bitrix;
name resolution only *reads* Bitrix) and can only mint/revoke `manager`
keys, so a compromised cabinet session can never create another head.
Schemas live in `web/api/v1/schemas.py`; the live OpenAPI spec is at
`/api/docs`.

## Layout

```
web/api/v1/
  views.py     # endpoints (router, auth dependencies, role checks, status mapping)
  service.py   # read queries over call_scores_latest / call_criteria_latest
  schemas.py   # response DTOs (the contract)
  okk.py       # ОКК 1–5 mapping + YYYY-MM period windows
  auth.py      # service bearer (fail-closed) + personal-key identity/role
companion_users.py        # CLI: issue/list/revoke personal keys
db/models/companion_user.py  # cabinet users (hashed key + role)
db/views.py    # reporting-view DDL shared by Alembic + the test harness
```

## Phase 2 sketch (when the money axis is built)

1. New ingestion concern: read-only `crm.deal.list` (cat 2) + `crm.lead.list`,
   reusing the existing cursor + manager-attribution machinery.
2. New `manager_metrics` table (or materialized view) keyed by manager+period.
3. Fill `MoneyAxis` in `service.get_scorecard` / `get_team_summary` and flip its
   `status`.
